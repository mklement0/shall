# SYNOPSIS
#   rreadlink symlink
# DESCRIPTION
#   Outputs the canonical path of the specified symlink's ultimate target.
#   If the argument is not a symlink, its own canonical path is output.
# NOTES
#   Attempts to use `readlink`, which is found on most modern platforms (notable exception: HP-UX)
#   If `readlink` is not available, output from `ls -l` is parsed, which is the only POSIX-compliant
#   way to determine a symlink's target; caveat: if a filename contains literal ' -> ', this will break.

SYNOPSIS
  $kTHIS_NAME [-w shellA,...] [-q|-Q] [-p opts] script      [arg ...]
  $kTHIS_NAME [-w shellA,...] [-q|-Q] [-p opts] -c command  [arg0 arg ...]
  $kTHIS_NAME [-w shellA,...] [-q|-Q] [-p opts] [-s          arg ...]
  $kTHIS_NAME [-w shellA,...]  -i

DESCRIPTION
  Invokes a shell script or command with multiple POSIX-like shells in
  sequence for cross-shell compatibility testing.

  Pass a *script filename* as the first operand, optionally followed by 
  arguments to pass to the script.
  If $kTHIS_NAME is in your PATH, you can also create executable scripts
  based on it by using the following shebang line:
    #!/usr/bin/env $kTHIS_NAME
  
  Use -c to specify a *command string* instead; note that the first argument
  after the command string is assigned to \$0(!).
  
  Use -s to read from *stdin*; -s is optional, if no arguments are passed.
  
  Use -i to enter *interactive mode*: a simple REPL, where one command
  at a time is read from the terminal and executed.

  By default, the following shells - if installed - are targeted:
    $(sed 's/ /, /g' <<<"${kDEFAULT_SHELLS[@]}")

  To specify shells explicitly, use either of the following (in order of
  precedence):
   - Option -w shellA,...; e.g., $kTHIS_NAME -w bash,zsh ...
   - Environment variable 'SHELLS'; e.g.: SHELLS=bash,zsh $kTHIS_NAME ...

  -q, -Q
    Quiet modes: 
     -q suppresses stdout output from the command/script invoked.
     -Q suppresses both stdout and stderr.
    Note that per-shell and overall success status information is still
    reported.

  -p 
    Allows you to pass options through to the shells invoked, as a single
    argument; e.g., -p '-e -o noglob'
    Make sure all shells targeted support the specified options; all
    POSIX-like should support the same options as the \`set\` builtin
    (see http://is.gd/MJPvPr).

NOTES
  The exit code reflects the number of shells that reported failure; i.e.,
  it is 0 if all shells ran the command successfully.

  Output is selectively colored, but only when outputting to a terminal.
  Note that only $kTHIS_NAME's *own* errors are sent to stderr, whereas
  captured command/script output (interleaved stdout and stderr) is always
  reported via stdout.
  When outputting to a terminal and a command/script's invocation fails for a
  given shell, the (entire) output captured is printed in red.
  
  Timing information is reported for each shell.
  
  In interactive mode (-i), history is maintained in file ${kREPL_HISTFILE/#$HOME/\$HOME}
  
  To get the name of the running shell from within your code in any of the
  invocation scenarios, use:
    \$(ps -o comm= \$\$)
  When using a command string (-c) or stdin input (-s), you can also
  use \$0

EXAMPLES
    # Echo the name of each executing shell.
  $kTHIS_NAME -c 'echo "Hello from \$0."'
    # Also echo the 1st argument passed.                
  echo 'echo "Passed to \$0: \$1"' | $kTHIS_NAME -s one
    # Execute a script, passing the -e shell option (abort on errror).
  $kTHIS_NAME -p '-e' someScript
    # Print the type of the 'which' command in bash and zsh.
  $kTHIS_NAME -w bash,zsh -c 'type which'
    # Enter a REPL that evaluates commands in both bash and dash.
  SHELLS=bash,dash $kTHIS_NAME -i
